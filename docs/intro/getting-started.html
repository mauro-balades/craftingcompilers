# Let's get started!

In order to build this compiler, we are going to need a few things:

* A computer
* Python 3.6 or higher
* llvmlite

# Lets create a new project

First, we need to create a new project. We can do this by creating a new directory and navigating to it:

\`\`\`bash
mkdir elysian
cd elysian
\`\`\`

# Create a new Python file

Next, we need to create a new Python file. We can do this by creating a new file called \`main.py\`:

\`\`\`bash
mkdir src
touch src/main.py
\`\`\`

# Install llvmlite

Next, we need to install llvmlite. We can do this by running the following command:

\`\`\`bash
pip install llvmlite==0.43.0
\`\`\`
