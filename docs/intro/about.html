# About The Elysian Programming Language

Elysian is a programming language that is designed to be simple, yet powerful language made with the intention of being easy to learn and use while being easylly extensible by the developer (*you*). The language is designed to be a general-purpose language that can be used for a wide variety of tasks, from simple scripting to complex applications.

Some of the features of this language are:

* Staticaly typed
* Compiles to executable code
* Hindley-Milner type inference
* Uses LLVM Backend

# How does it look like?

Here is a simple example of what Elysian code looks like:

\`\`\`python
def main(): i32 {
    let x: i32 = 5;
    let y: i32 = 10;
    let z: i32 = x + y;
    return z;
}
\`\`\`

# How are we going to do this?

We are going to use \`TypeScript\` for our compiler along with \`node-llvm\` in order to compile into an executable but you can use whatever you want!

This project will try to be as simple as possible so that you can make it in the language you prefer and customize Elsyian to your liking.
